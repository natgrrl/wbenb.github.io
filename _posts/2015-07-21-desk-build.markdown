## Purpose
Now that my PC setup was expanding after my custon PC build, I needed a desk upgrade. After looking around, I found that building my own desk would be the best way to get a desk that truly matches my needs, so I started looking at DIY desk designs online.

## Materials
* 6 Foot Craftsman Solid Wood Butcher Block Workbench Top
* 1" Black Iron Piping and Various pipe joints
* Ikea Signum Cable management trays

## Details
For my desk, I decided on a design using a solid slab of wood for the top, and frame made of black iron piping (like used for natural gas) from the hardware store. I measured how high i wanted the desk off the ground and the spacing where i wanted the legs to be. I used pipe end caps on the bottom of the legs that touches the carpet, and pipe floor flanges on the top to allow me to screw on the table top. I incorporated a horizontal support going from the left side legs to the right. This adds resistance to side to side movement, and doubles as a footrest. The finishing touch was attaching the cheap Ikea Signum trays to the bottom of the desk. This allows me to create a very clean looking PC setup by tucking all the cords a power strips up into the tray to get them off the floor.
