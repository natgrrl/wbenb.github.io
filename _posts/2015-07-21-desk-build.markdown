## Purpose
After my custom PC build, I needed a desk upgrade due to space issues. After looking around, I found that building my own desk would be the best way to get a desk that truly matches my budget, needs and taste in furniture.  I like the industrial look and feel of some desk images I found online and felt that I could build it myself to save money.

## Materials
* 6 Foot Craftsman Solid Wood Butcher Block Workbench Top
* 1" Black Iron Piping and Various pipe joints
* Ikea Signum Cable management trays

## Details
I decided on a design using a solid slab of wood for the top, and frame made of black iron piping (like used for natural gas) from the hardware store. I measured how high I wanted the desk off the ground and the spacing I wanted for the legs. I used pipe end caps for the bottom of the legs where they touch the carpet, and pipe floor flanges where the legs screw onto the table top. I incorporated a back, horizontal support extending from the left side legs to the right side legs. That support added resistance to side to side movement, and doubles as a footrest. The finishing touch was attaching the cheap Ikea Signum trays to the bottom of the desk. This allowed me to create a very clean looking PC setup by tucking all the cords and power strips up into the tray getting them off the floor.
