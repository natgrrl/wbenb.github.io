## Overview
I saw lots of designs and parts for making your own custom quadcopter on the internet. I looked into it and started researching parts that I used to make a beginner quadcopter complete with programmable flight controller, and video camera feeds back to the controller or to an FPV headset.

## Parts
* SP Racing F3 Flight Controller
* Matek 2-4S Power Distribution Board
* DX2205 2300KV Brushless Motors
* LittleBee 20 Amp Brushless Motor Speed Controllers
* LHI Full Carbon Fiber 220mm Frame
* 3S Lithium Polymer Battery
* Eachine Video Transmitter
* Eachine TV Video Display
* 700TVL FPV Camera 
* Flysky X6B Receiver
* Flysky FS i6X Transmitter

## Details
I got many of these parts in a bundle from Amazon for much cheaper. To build a Quadcopter this size requires some planning, wire management, and fine soldering work. Once I had the motors, power distribution board, motor controllers, and flight controller set up, I was able to plug it into my computer and start programming the flight controller. After that I was able to hook up my transmitter and reciever and take it for a test fly. I found that flying a quad like this one takes a lot of time to learn, because you can control every axis independently, and I even do flips, if I program it to use the correct auto-leveling mode. My next upgrade was adding the video camera system. This consists of a small 'security camera' style camera with extremely low latency, a high power transmitter, and a screen with reciever built-in. I wired up the camera and transmitter on my quad, and 3D printed a mounting bracket to seccure the screen to the top of my controller, so that as I fly, I can see the live video feed from the drone on the screen.
