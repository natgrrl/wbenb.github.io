Responsible for designing and building the robotâ€™s electrical & pneumatics system, training sub-team members, and debugging electrical and non-electrical problems under pressure as part of the pit crew during competitions.  Triple Helix advanced to the FIRST World Championship in St. Louis for the last 4 years!

This is a picture of the robot we built in 2015 to play the game Recycle Rush. The main goal of this games is to stack totes up to six high and top the stack with a trashcan containing a pool noodle to get the max points. Our robot uses the "Doc Oc Arm" as seen in the photo to pick up trashcans through the hole in the center and put them in the claw to be held while totes are stacked underneath them and pushes it up.
