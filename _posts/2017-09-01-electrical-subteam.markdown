Responsible for designing and building the robotâ€™s electrical & pneumatics system, training sub-team members, and debugging electrical and non-electrical problems under pressure as part of the pit crew during competitions.  Triple Helix advanced to the FIRST World Championship in St. Louis for the last 4 years!

This is a picture of the robot we built in 2015 to play the game Recycle Rush. The main goal of this games is to stack totes up to six high and top the stack with a trashcan containing a pool noodle to get the max points. Our robot uses the "Doc Oc Arm" as seen in the photo to pick up trashcans through the hole in the center and put them in the claw to be held while totes are stacked underneath them and pushes it up.

This is our 2016 robot that we built to play the game Stronghold. In stronghold, the robots have to cross defences to get to the other side of the feild in order to score points by putting a ball into the high or low goal on the opponents tower. One of these defences, called the low bar stays the same, one is selected by the audience, and three are selected by the opposing team. We built our robot to be able to cross all the defences while being robust and able to score in the low goal, and climb then hang from the opponents tower at the end of the round for extra points. Our robot design did all of these things while still managing to fit under the low bar at 16 inches high.

This is our 2017 robot that we built to play the game Steamworks. In Steamworks, robots score points by picking up gears and placing on the pegs, by shooting fuel into the high goal, dumping fuel into the low goal, then climbing the ropes on the side of the "airship" at the end of the round. Our robot is built primarily to place as many gears as possible, then climb. However, during the season we were constantly working on trying out different fuel shooter designs at competitions. Something unique about this years robot is that in addition to having a regular set of six wheels, it has a set of four drop down caster wheels that can be deployed to lift the robot off the ground slightly allowing for more manueverability.
