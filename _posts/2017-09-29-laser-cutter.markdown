## Purpose
During the robotics build season we only have 6 weeks to build the robot, so we dont have alot of time to design, prototype, and test parts of the robot. The team was offered the chance to buy a old laser cutter, missing some parts, from one of the mentor's coworkers. We decided that it would be very helpful to use the laser cutter to make prototype parts faster, and more accurately out of wood or plastics. Once we got the old laser cutter up and running with the old parts, we got all brand new parts to build a new one from scratch that is double the power, and double the size.
